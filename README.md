**African Music Genre Classifier 🌍🎵**
An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for the acquisition and classification of African musical genres.

**📖 Overview**
This repository contains the codebase for a deep learning project aimed at classifying distinct African music genres (e.g., Afrobeat, Highlife, Amapiano, Soukous, Chimurenga). The project consists of two main modules:

**Data Acquisition Agent:** An automated bot designed for mass downloading and organizing audio samples to construct a robust dataset.

**Classification Model:** A Jupyter Notebook containing the preprocessing logic, feature extraction (MFCCs/Spectrograms), and model training pipeline.

**🎯 Target Genres**
The model is currently trained to distinguish between the following classes:

Afrobeat

Afrobeats

Amapiano

Highlife

Makosa

Kwaito

Soukous

Juju

Fuji

Congolese Rumba
